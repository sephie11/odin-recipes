    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown sausage and ground beef with onion and garlic in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium heat, cooking and stirring until the meat is cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, Italian-style crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, 2 tablespoons parsley, brown sugar, salt, Italian seasoning, black pepper, fennel seeds, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer the sauce for at least 1 hour (up to 6 hours for best flavor), stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Place lasagna noodles into a deep bowl and cover with very hot tap water; let soak for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat egg in a bowl and stir ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg into the egg until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 cup sauce. Layer 4 soaked lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the dish.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers twice more, ending with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake until the lasagna noodles are tender and the casserole is bubbling, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove foil and bake until the cheese topping is lightly browned, about 10 to 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna stand for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
